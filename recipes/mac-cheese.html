    <h2>This is a wondefully cheesey vegan dish!</h2>
    <p> This vegan mac and cheese recipe is incredibly creamy and remarkably cheese-like! You won’t believe how delicious dairy-free mac and cheese can be. Recipe yields 2 large or 4 modest servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces whole-grain macaroni elbows</li>
        <li>1 head of broccoli, florets cut into small bites (about 1 ½ to 2 cups), optional*</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped (about 1 ½ cups)</li>
        <li>1 cup peeled and grated russet potato (4 ounces, about 1 small or ½ medium potato), preferably organic</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>Small pinch of Frontier Co-op red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>⅔ cup raw cashews**</li>
        <li>1 cup water, more as necessary</li>
        <li>¼ cup Frontier Co-op nutritional yeast </li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook according to package directions. If using broccoli, stir it into the pot when just 2 to 3 more minutes remain. Drain, and transfer the contents to a large serving bowl. </li> 
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium-to-large saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cashews and water, and stir to combine. Let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently and reducing heat as necessary to avoid a rapid boil, until the potatoes are completely tender and cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour the mixture into a blender. Add the nutritional yeast and 2 teaspoons vinegar. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides if necessary. If the mixture won’t blend easily or if you would prefer a thinner consistency, add water in ¼ cup increments, blending after each one.</li>
        <li>Taste, and blend in additional salt until the sauce is utterly irresistible (I typically add at least another ½ teaspoon). If it needs a little more zip, add the remaining teaspoon of vinegar. Blend again. </li>
        <li>our the sauce into the bowl of pasta. Stir until well combined, and serve immediately. Leftovers keep well, chilled and covered, for 3 to 4 days. Gentle reheat, adding a tiny splash of water if necessary to loosen up the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
